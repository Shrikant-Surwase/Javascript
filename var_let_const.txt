1)Javascript having two versions mainly
a)ES5 b)ES6

var in ES5
let and const in ES6

main difference between the var and let is that

##var is function scoped hai means apn ekbar var declare kre to yahi variable
##apn sare function me kidar bhi use kr sakte

##let is braces scoped hai mean apn ye only braces me tak hi use kr sakte

#function abc(){
  for(var i=1; i<3; i++){
   console.log(i);
}
console.log(i+1);

}
//output is 1,2,4 here we can say that the var is function scoped hai


#function abc(){
 for(let i=1; i<3; i++){
  console.log(i);
}
console.log(i);
}
//output is i is not declare here we can say that the let is only braces scooped 
means we can access the variable value upto the closing braces


##var adds itself to the widow object
##let does not add itseld to the window object
